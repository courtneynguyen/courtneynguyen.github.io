Finding Clovers
===================

Finding Clovers is a top-down Canvas RPG. You are a warrior princess named Lila out to collect all of the flavors of clovers. Most of these clovers are power ups that will aid you on your adventure for the ultimate clover, but beware, because there are goblins, spiked turtles, and mean warthogs out to steal and eat your clovers!

### Plan to Add

This game was built in 2 weeks with a team of 3. There are many more features we would like to add into the game mechanics such as:

1. Loading screen
2. The Golden Clover 
	- At the end, the hero will receive an awesome Golden Clover for all of her work and excellent fighting skills.
3. NPCs
	- This adds a more Zelda-like mechanic to the game that was an idea, but became a stretch goal.
4. Bartering between the NPCs and Hero
5. Weapons to trade
